# Vercel ignore file
# Note: We're deploying both frontend (dist/) and backend (backend/)
# Only ignore development and build files that aren't needed in production

# Development files
.env.local
.env.development
*.log

# Documentation (large files not needed at runtime)
README.md
PITCH_DECK.md
DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md

# Build artifacts (already built, don't need sources)
.netlify/

# Keep build configs - Vercel needs these to build the project
# vite.config.ts - Required for Vite build
# tsconfig.*.json - Required for TypeScript compilation
