- **60% of population** lives in rural areas with minimal healthcare infrastructure

### 💰 High Cost of Healthcare
- **47% of Kenyans** spend out-of-pocket for healthcare
- Average consultation fee: **KES 500-2,000** ($3.50-$14)
- Many avoid seeking care due to cost uncertainty

### 📱 Digital Divide in Healthcare
- **88% smartphone penetration** but limited digital health solutions

### 🌍 Language Barriers
